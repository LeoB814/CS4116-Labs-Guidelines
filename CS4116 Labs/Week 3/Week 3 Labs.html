<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;In CS4116 lab work is optional. These lab sheets are designed to help ensure that you understand and are keeping up with the material. During the labs, one of the TAs will work through these questions. You are encouraged to attempt to answer these yourself&nbsp;<strong>first</strong>, and then attend the labs. You will have an opportunity to ask questions either during their presentation or afterwards.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a folder named&nbsp;<strong>week03.</strong></li>
<li>Create a webpage called&nbsp;<strong>week3-1.html</strong>&nbsp;that looks this (click to see larger version).<br><img alt="" height="186" src="Labs/week03.png" width="456"></li>
<li>Copy that&nbsp;file to&nbsp;<strong>week3-2.html</strong>&nbsp;and use an external stylesheet called&nbsp;<strong>week3-2.css</strong>&nbsp;that looks this (click to see larger version).<br><img alt="" height="228" src="Labs/week03a.png" width="600"></li>
<li>Create a third page,&nbsp;<strong>week3-3.html</strong>, that is a copy of&nbsp;<strong>week3-2.html</strong>&nbsp;except that it uses a different CSS stylesheet that makes it look like this.<br><img alt="" height="215" src="Labs/week03b.png" width="600"></li>
<li>Make sure that the links on the pages point to the right pages, i.e.&nbsp;<em>Style File 1</em>&nbsp;links to week3-1.html, and&nbsp;<em>Style File 2</em>&nbsp;links to week3-2.html, etc.</li>

<li>Using&nbsp;<strong>DIVS</strong>&nbsp;and the images that you download from the web (you do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;have to find matching images, just ones that are roughly the same size, that is, 460x300px) , create a web page that approximates it. Call this page <strong>week3-4.html</strong></li>
