<ul>
<li>Editing files</li>
<li>Viewing files in browser</li>
<li>Generating HTML from a design mock-up</li>
<li>Creating tables</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In CS4116 lab work is optional. These lab sheets are designed to help ensure that you understand and are keeping up with the material. During the labs, one of the TAs will work through these questions on the board. To get the best value from the labs, you are encouraged to attempt to answer all the questions yourself before you attend.</p>
<p>You can ask questions both while they are working through the solutions and also once they are finished, if you have any questions about your code.</p>
