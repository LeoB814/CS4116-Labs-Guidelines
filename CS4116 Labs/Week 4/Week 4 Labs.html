<ul>
<li>PHP</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;In CS4116 lab work is optional. These lab sheets are designed to help ensure that you understand and are keeping up with the material. During the labs, one of the TAs will work through these questions. You are encouraged to attempt to answer these yourself&nbsp;<strong>first</strong>, and then attend the labs. You will have an opportunity to ask questions either during their presentation or afterwards.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a folder named&nbsp;<strong>week04.</strong>&nbsp;These labs will help you create a set of templates that will be useful for your project, so you are advised to keep them organised.&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>Write a PHP program that has two variables, lower and upper, each of which is assigned a value (where lower is the lower one). Write code to do each of the following:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use each of a for, while and do loop to iterate through the values, writing out the each intermediate value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do the same, but only write out every second value</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterate from upper down to lower, outputting every third value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generate an array that holds the following key/value pairs:</p>
<div class="table-responsive">
<table class="table table-condensed table-striped" style="width: 100%;">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Key</th>
<th scope="col">Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>23</td>
<td>John</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>16</td>
<td>Edward</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>81</td>
<td>Conor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>14</td>
<td>Gauri</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>99</td>
<td>Allan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Write code that does each of the following:</p>
</li>
<li>Iterate through the array and show each item in the order that they are in the table</li>
<li>Find the highest key and output it</li>
<li>Output the items in the array in their key order (i.e. start with Allan, finish with John). You might find the count() function useful. This takes an array as the argument and returns the number of items.</li>
<li>Modify the array so that the names are the keysIterate through this new array and increment each value by 10</li>
