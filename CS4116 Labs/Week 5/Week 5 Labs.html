<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;In CS4116 lab work is optional. These lab sheets are designed to help ensure that you understand and are keeping up with the material. During the labs, one of the TAs will work through these questions. You are encouraged to attempt to answer these yourself&nbsp;<strong>first</strong>, and then attend the labs. You will have an opportunity to ask questions either during their presentation or afterwards.</p>
